IS 407 - Homework 1
-------------

Due by 09:00 am on Thursday 02/03/2022.

## Background

Plastic pollution is a major and growing problem, negatively affecting oceans and wildlife health.
[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution) has a lot of great data at various levels including globally, per country, and over time.
For this individual homework we focus on data from 2010.

Additionally, National Geographic ran a data visualization communication contest on plastic waste as seen [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/funding-opportunities/innovation-challenges/plastic/dataviz/).

## Learning goals

-   Visualizing numerical and categorical data and interpreting visualizations
-   Recreating visualizations
-   Getting more practice using with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub

## Getting started

Grab the URL of this repo, and clone this in RStudio.

Refer to [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) if you would like to see step-by-step instructions for cloning a repo into an RStudio project.

## Submission and Grading

This homework is due by *09:00 am Thursday, February 03th*. You are to complete the assignment as an individual and to keep everything (code, write ups, etc.) on your personal repository (commit early and often). 

The total point is 8 (1 per each question).

The final product for this assignment should be a single Rmd document (a template of which is provided in your repo) that contains all code and text for the tasks described above. This document should be clearly and cleanly formated and present all of your results. Style and formating does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your text and code are properly formated. This document must be reproducible and I must be able to compile it with minimal intervention - documents that do not compile will be given a 0.

In this class I will not be enforcing any particular coding style, however it is important that the code you produce is *readable* and *consistent* in its formating. There are several R style guides online, e.g. from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and from [Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).
